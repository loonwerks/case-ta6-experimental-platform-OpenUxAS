// Single sender multiple receiver Queue implementation for AADL Event Data
// Ports. Every receiver receives the sent data (ie brodcast). The queue
// operations are all non-blocking. The sender enqueue always succeeds. A
// receiver dequeue can fail and drop data if the sender writes while the
// receiver is reading. This situation is detected unless the sender gets
// ahead of a receiver by more than COUNTER_MAX. Since COUNTER_MAX is typically
// 2^64 (see counter.h), this is extremely unlikely. If it does happen the
// only adverse effect is that the receiver will not detect all dropped
// elements.
